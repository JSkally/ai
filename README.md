Instructions
------------
To set this up, you'll need a virtualenv and pip.
If you don't know how to do that, read this: http://dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/
After that, activate the virtualenv and run 

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

from a terminal.
That will set up the environment appropriately.
After the packages are installed, run

  `python app.py`

To run the app.
It will be listening on port 8004, so the URL is http://127.0.0.1:8004
